# Apache HttpClient Benchmark

#### Objectives

This benchmark makes no attempts at being scientific, comprehensive or complete. The only objective of this project 
is to establish a comparative benchmark of various Apache HttpClient and other popular HTTP libraries in simple, 
non-precise but verifiable terms such asf more or fewer message exchange per second given the same execution 
context, equal execution task and comparable configuration. The benchmark does attempt to maximize execution 
performance of HTTP libraries used by the benchmark leveraging APIs exposed by those libraries.

#### Disclaimer

This benchmark represents my personal efforts at measuring and improving performance of Apache HttpClient.
This project is by no means or in any way associated with Apache Software Foundation or Apache HttpComponents project.

While I do make a conscious effort to remain objective I do fully admit my personal bias toward Apache HttpClient.
At same time I will happily take external contributions improving performance of non Apache HttpComponents libraries
or making the overall benchmark design fairer or preciser. 

#### Results

Current benchmark results can be found [at the project Wiki](https://github.com/BencoXX/httpclient-benchmark/wiki)
